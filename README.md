In this project, you will learn to implement Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using PHP. The MVC concept separates an application into three main components:

 - Model: Manages the data and business logic of the application. It usually deals with the database.
 - View: Presents the data to the user. Responsible for the user interface and experience.
 - Controller: Manages the flow of the application, connecting the Model and View. Manages user input and processes application logic.
